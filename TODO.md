# RadAlert TODO

## Completed

### Standalone watchOS Refactor
- [x] Create watchOS `BluetoothManager.swift` (BLE scanning, auto-connect, threat parsing + dedup, haptic alerts)
- [x] Update `WatchAppState.swift` — add `isRadarConnected` property
- [x] Replace `WatchConnectivityManager` with `BluetoothManager` at app entry point
- [x] Delete `WatchConnectivityManager.swift` from watchOS target
- [x] Update Xcode project file — added BluetoothManager to watchOS Sources, removed WatchConnectivityManager
- [x] Add `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` to watchOS build settings
- [x] Fix HealthKit entitlements — removed `healthkit.access` (Health Records), kept basic `healthkit`
- [x] Remove iOS app and test targets entirely
- [x] Configure watch as standalone (`WKRunsIndependentlyOfCompanionApp = YES`)

### Development Experience
- [x] **Simulator support** — `BluetoothManager` uses `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)` to simulate radar connection (2s delay), periodic fake threats (every 4s), and an unexpected disconnect (at 20s) without any BLE hardware
- [x] **Visual threat indicator** — red border flashes on `WorkoutView` when a threat is detected, making haptic events visible in the simulator
- [x] **Stub iOS companion app** (`VariAlertStub`) — prevents watchOS from orphan-cleaning the watch app during local development; includes step-by-step removal instructions

### Reliability & Safety UX
- [x] **Radar disconnect notification** — unexpected mid-ride disconnect plays `.failure` haptic, flashes orange border, shows "Radar Lost" status, then auto-retries scanning after 2s; explicit stop does not trigger the alert
- [x] **Scan retry** — 15s scan timeout stops a stalled scan; "Scan Again" button appears whenever not connected and not scanning

### Workout UX
- [x] **Long-press → confirmation screen** — Resume / End and Save / End and Discard; visual hierarchy green/secondary/destructive
- [x] **End and Save** — persists `HKWorkout` via `HKWorkoutBuilder.finishWorkout()`
- [x] **End and Discard** — calls `discardWorkout()`; no data saved
- [x] **Haptic alerts suppressed during confirmation** — `bluetoothManager.alertsEnabled = false` while sheet is shown
- [x] **Session expiry handling** — `onSessionExpired` callback returns app to idle if watchOS unexpectedly ends the session
- [x] **Elapsed Time stopwatch** — MM:SS (H:MM:SS after 60 min) replaces time-of-day clock
- [x] **Vehicle Count** — cumulative session total; resets on new ride
- [x] **"Long press to stop" hint** — caption label below Stop button

### App Naming & Branding
- [x] **Rename app and project** — renamed to **RadAlert** (subtitle: "Radar Alerts for Cyclists")
- [x] **Rename GitHub repo** — renamed to `RadAlert` on GitHub; local remote URL updated
- [x] **Rename "Idle State" label** — changed to "RadAlert"

### Legal & Compliance
- [x] **In-app disclaimer screen** — absorbed into `OnboardingView.swift` page 3; gated via `@AppStorage("hasCompletedOnboarding")`
- [x] **App Store description disclaimer** — safety/liability text; see Notes below
- [x] **Privacy policy** — `docs/privacy.html`; served via GitHub Pages at https://carlineng.github.io/RadAlert/privacy.html

## App Store Readiness

### Prerequisites
- [ ] **Paid Apple Developer Program membership** ($99/yr) — required to submit to App Store; personal/free team cannot submit
- [ ] **Remove VariAlertStub iOS target** — must be removed before App Store submission (Apple guideline 4.2); removal requires paid account so App Store distribution manages watch app persistence instead; see `VariAlertStub/StubApp.swift` for instructions
- [x] **Enable GitHub Pages** — live at https://carlineng.github.io/RadAlert/privacy.html

### Core UX / App Review Requirements
- [x] **Onboarding + permission flow** — `OnboardingView.swift`; 3-page TabView (what it does / what you need / safety notice); "Get Started" calls `bluetoothManager.initialize()` + `workoutManager.requestAuthorization`; persisted via `@AppStorage("hasCompletedOnboarding")`
- [x] **Bluetooth permission denial handling** — `BluetoothDeniedView` (inline in RadAlertApp.swift); shown when `bluetoothState == .unauthorized`; instructs user to enable in iPhone Settings → Privacy & Security → Bluetooth; `CBCentralManager` init deferred to "Get Started"
- [x] **HealthKit permission denial handling** — `HealthKitDeniedView` (inline in RadAlertApp.swift); shown when HK status is not `.sharingAuthorized`; instructs user to enable in iPhone Settings → Health → Data Access & Devices
- [x] **ContentView routing** — onboarding → BT unknown (spinner) → BT denied → HK denied → idle/workout
- [x] **Remove `DisclaimerView.swift`** — deleted; content absorbed into onboarding page 3

### Polish
- [ ] **App icon** — required for App Store submission
- [ ] **Version and build number** — set appropriately before submission
- [ ] **Screenshot(s)** — App Store requires at least one Apple Watch screenshot

### App Store Connect Setup
- [ ] Create app record in App Store Connect
- [ ] Configure HealthKit data types in App Store Connect (required when using HealthKit entitlement)
- [ ] Write App Store description, keywords, and support URL
- [ ] Link privacy policy URL (https://carlineng.github.io/RadAlert/privacy.html)

## Notes
- Workout session (`HKWorkoutSession` + `HKLiveWorkoutBuilder`) maintains background execution and optionally saves ride data to Apple Health
- Haptic alerts only fire during active workout mode; suppressed during end-of-ride confirmation sheet
- Auto-connect to first discovered Garmin Varia (no manual device selection)
- Haptic pattern: 4× `.retry` pulses, 0.3s spacing
- `VariAlertStub` iOS target exists only to satisfy the companion app check during development; see `VariAlertStub/StubApp.swift` for removal instructions
- `WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier = com.carlineng.RadAlert` is required by WatchKit installer (bundle ID prefix constraint); remove when removing the stub
